```
###NOTE: Follow similar instructions on https://www.python.org/ to get python on windows or macOS
### Get the repositiory
```
username@ubuntu:~$ git clone https://github.com/fourier-being/Least-Squared-Error-Based-FIR-Filters.git
```
### Go to the Repo Directory
```
username@ubuntu:~$ cd Least-Squared-Error-Based-FIR-Filters/
```
### Run the Python script
```
username@ubuntu:~/Least-Squared-Error-Based-FIR-Filters$ python LSDesignAdvanced.py
```
> After running the python script, you should see the following GUI :
